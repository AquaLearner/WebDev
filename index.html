            <div class="small-box" id="small-box1">Paneer</div>
            Paneer is a fresh cheese widely used in Indian cuisine. It is made by curdling milk with an acid, such as
            lemon juice or vinegar, and then pressing the curds to form a solid block. Paneer has a mild, slightly tangy
            taste and a crumbly texture. It is a versatile ingredient and is commonly used in a variety of Indian
            dishes, such as curries, gravies, and desserts. Due to its ability to absorb flavors, paneer is often
            marinated or spiced before being cooked.

            <div class="small-box" id="small-box2">Ghewar</div>
            Ghewar is a traditional Rajasthani sweet dish, particularly popular during festivals like Teej and Raksha
            Bandhan. It is made from a batter of wheat flour and milk, deep-fried to create a lacy, disc-shaped sweet.
            Once fried, the ghewar is soaked in sugar syrup, giving it a sweet and syrupy taste. It is often garnished
            with almonds, pistachios, and edible silver or gold foil. Ghewar has a unique texture, combining the
            crispiness of the fried exterior with the softness inside.

            <div class="small-box" id="small-box3">Ras Malai</div>
            Ras Malai is a classic Indian dessert that originates from Bengal. It consists of soft, flattened paneer
            balls or patties, known as "malai," which are soaked in sweetened, thickened milk flavored with cardamom,
            saffron, and sometimes pistachios or almonds. The term "ras" refers to the creamy, flavored milk. The paneer
            patties in Ras Malai are typically made from paneer, kneaded well to achieve a smooth texture. This dessert
            is served chilled and is loved for its rich and indulgent taste.
